# Decisions

What was settled, and why. Build to these; don't relitigate them.

Numbers in brackets are the section of the build plan a decision came from.

## Settled before the build

1. **DELETE removes the list from this device only.** No server call, no
   revocation. The confirm shows the code first, because that screen is the
   last place on the device it exists. [§12.1]
2. **CLEAR sweeps `done` tasks and only those.** Half-done stays. A confirm
   _and_ a ten-second undo: the confirm stops the accident, the undo covers the
   change of mind. [§12.2, §12.16]
3. **Tap toggles to-do and done; long-press sets half.** `Shift+Space` is the
   keyboard equivalent. [§12.3]
4. **Joining with local tasks asks whether to merge or discard.** Never
   silently. [§12.5]
5. **Reordering is long-press and drag, with no handle.** The checkbox keeps
   its own long-press, so the two gestures are separated by hit area rather
   than by timing. [§12.6]
6. **IMPORT and EXPORT are clipboard-only markdown**, `##` for groups. Import
   adds by default and offers replace; duplicates in the same group are
   skipped and counted. [§12.7]
7. **Labels are uppercased in CSS only.** A group typed as "Weekend jobs" still
   exports as "Weekend jobs". [§12.8]
8. **Limits: 100 characters per task, 100 tasks, 50 characters per group title,
   20 groups, 128 KB per blob.** Enforced on input, never by discarding in
   merge. [§12.9]
9. **Six-month expiry, swept by a daily cron.** Editing keeps a list alive;
   reading does not. [§12.10]
10. **Storage is one JSON file per list in Vercel Blob.** No database, no rate
    limiter, no atomic compare-and-set. [§12.12]
11. **Consummatum.** When the last open task is ticked, the toast reads
    _Consummatum_. Once, no animation, and never on an empty sheet. [§12.13]
12. **No chrome.** No app name on screen, no add buttons, no tooltips, no
    empty-state copy. Adding is an empty checkbox; a new group is an underlined
    `…` in header type. [§12.14]
13. **Installable, with icons drawn at build time** so no raster asset is ever
    committed. [§12.15]
14. **The app opens scrolled** so the torn top edge sits at the viewport top.
    [§12.17]
15. **SHARE fires the native share sheet first**, with a bare URL and the code
    as text — never the code in the URL — and then opens the modal. [§12.18]
16. **One hand-rolled modal component**: full-white panel, swipe-down to
    dismiss, `✕`, Escape. Never `window.confirm()`. [§12.19]

## Settled during the build

17. **`CODE_LENGTH = 12`, not 8.** Forty-eight bits. Everything goes through
    our own origin, but there is no rate limiter behind it, so guessing is
    bounded only by request rate and PBKDF2 cost — at 32 bits that is days of
    work for someone determined. Twelve characters make it roughly 65,000 times
    more. The salt stays frozen at `consumma:v1`. [reopened §12.20]

18. **Sync is entirely manual.** No poll interval, no visibility or reconnect
    triggers, no push debounce, no queue that flushes. One `syncNow()` on the
    SYNC tap, doing both directions, behind a ten-second cooldown.

    Polling was the expensive part — one blob operation every eight seconds per
    open tab, about 10,800 a day for a tab left visible — and pushing without
    being asked is what turns a shared list into something that happens to you.
    The cost is real and is stated rather than designed around: an edit nobody
    syncs reaches nobody and dies with the device. Three things already in the
    design carry it, and no fourth was added — the status mark is hollow
    whenever edits are unsent, the SYNC panel names how many, and the DELETE
    confirm says so.

19. **QR code in SHARE and a "move everyone to a new code" flow are out of
    scope.** A leaked code has no remedy but everyone joining a new one, and the
    README says so. [closed §12.21, §12.22]

20. **Markdown half-done is `- [~]` on export**; import also accepts `[/]` and
    `[-]`, which other apps use. [closed §12.23]

## Corrections to the build plan

Each of these is a deviation, recorded so it reads as deliberate rather than as
drift.

21. **The browser never talks to the blob host.** §5 says so; §3, §9 and §11
    still described reads coming straight from the CDN. §5 is right — it is what
    makes `connect-src 'self'` possible — so `PUBLIC_BLOB_BASE` and the
    `/api/room/[roomId]/version` route are both gone.

22. **Stamps come from a per-device monotonic clock**, `t = max(now, last + 1)`,
    persisted beside the client id. Without it, two edits from one device in the
    same millisecond collide on `(t, c)` and merge stops being commutative. The
    comparator also falls back to the value itself, which makes it total for any
    document, including a corrupt one.

23. **`merge` takes no clock.** Skew clamping (`clampStamps(doc, now)`) and
    tombstone collection (`gc(doc, now)`) are separate functions applied by the
    sync and write paths. Folding either into merge would destroy the algebra
    the property tests check.

24. **Every write is read back once.** Blob storage has no compare-and-set, so
    two writers can both pass the version check and the second one's bytes win.
    The loser cannot tell from the version number — it was told 2, the server
    holds 2, and its next conditional read returns 304 forever. The
    unconditional read-back is the only thing that catches it.
    `tests/sync.spec.ts` sets the race up deliberately; removing the read-back
    makes it fail.

25. **The ETag is the document's own version**, not the blob's upload time and
    size. The latter answers a conditional read without fetching the body, but
    two writes in the same millisecond whose JSON is the same length produce an
    identical token, and the second is reported as unchanged. A saved fetch is
    not worth a lost edit.

26. **The crypto envelope carries a version byte**: `base64(0x01 ‖ iv ‖
ciphertext)`, with the plaintext always deflate-raw. §3 called compression
    optional, but it cannot be past the first write — a reader cannot tell a
    compressed payload from an uncompressed one.

27. **`style-src` carries one pinned hash under `'unsafe-hashes'`.**
    SvelteKit's own `#svelte-announcer` has a hardcoded `style` attribute we do
    not author and cannot switch off. `'unsafe-hashes'` permits that exact
    string and nothing else; it is not `'unsafe-inline'`. `trusted-types` names
    two framework policies, `svelte-trusted-html` and `sveltekit-trusted-url`.
    `e2e/csp.e2e.ts` fails on any console error, so an upgrade that changes the
    string breaks CI rather than the policy.

## Known limits

- **Lose the code, lose the list.** No account, no email, no recovery. EXPORT
  is the only backup.
- **A shared code cannot be taken back.** Anyone holding it has full read and
  write access, and DELETE only clears your own device.
- **An unsynced edit reaches nobody** and is lost with the device.
- **A list nobody edits for six months is deleted.**
- **End-to-end encryption protects the data at rest**, not against the origin
  serving the JavaScript.
- **Hobby is non-commercial.** The moment this has a paid tier or ads it moves
  to Pro.
