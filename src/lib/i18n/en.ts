 * has to go inside the sentence. A function rather than a template with holes
 * punched in it, because plural agreement is part of the sentence and not a
 * decoration on top of it — English needs the count to pick the words, and a
 * language with more forms than two needs it to pick more of them. `plural`
 * below is English's rule and English's alone; another catalogue brings its own.
 *
 * What is NOT here: anything the person typed. A task, a group title, a list
 * name and a code are content, and content is never translated — see
 * `doc.firstGroup`, which is the one place the two meet and is commented there.
