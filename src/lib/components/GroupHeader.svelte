		Collapsed it reads (1/3) — what is still to do, out of what is hidden.
		The bare total answered the wrong question: a group is folded away
		because it is dealt with or because it is not yet, and how many tasks
		are under there says neither. Half done counts as still to do, because
		it is. Nothing done at all and the fraction says nothing either, since
		both halves are the same number, so it goes back to being a total.
		Expanded it reads (…), the same ellipsis an untitled group and the add
		row use for "there is more here".

		Round brackets, and Graphe draws them itself: they run from 20 above
		the baseline to 1 below against its figures' 19 above to 3 above, so
		they enclose what they hold and need no correcting. Square ones it has
		none of, so the platform substituted a face that sets them on the true
		baseline and they sat visibly low around the numbers — and the fix for
		that was a measured lift, which is a lot of machinery for a character
		the face has a proper answer to. This is not the markdown checkbox,
		which keeps its square brackets and its deliberate fallback.

		One tap folds this group and a long press folds every group on the
		sheet — the icon is the fold control, so more of the gesture belongs to
		it. The press is what makes a long list navigable; the tap is unchanged.

		The mousedown guard matters while editing — a mousedown on the icon
		there must not steal focus from the field, or the blur it causes
		commits the row out from under the tap — and costs nothing in the
		display state, where there is no field to blur.
