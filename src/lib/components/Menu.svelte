	 * sheet, and for the same reason: the margin the writing is held off the
	 * edge by.

	 * The h2 under it brings its own room, so the space belongs to the line
	 * above rather than being split between the two.

	 * Below, `.scroll` clips at the paper's own edge — without room here the
	 * credit sits flush against it once someone has scrolled all the way
	 * down, whatever its last line happens to be. One line's own height, at
	 * the credit's own size, so the room below it reads as a line rather
